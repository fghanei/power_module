ACS712 current sensor is simple

it states in the datasheet that it is supposed to cover -20 to 20 Amper with a sensitivity of 100mv/A
and should output a voltage of VCC*0.5 for 0 current. so that should be around 2.4V for 4.8 VCC.
The ADC + 4 sensors connected to the pi, in working condition, have a VCC of 4.94V (pi's 5V VDD was 4.95, so almost no drop)

*VCC should be a parameter in the measurements scripts

ADC128d818 ADC is supposed to convert the sensor output voltage to digital data and send through i2c

datasheet pages 8, 16, 17 ...  28 for applications

* Among modes 0,1,2,3 we choose mode1 which has 8 single ended channels.
* continues conversion time is 12 ms
* if the external VREF is preferred, use the Advanced Configuration Register — Address 0Bh to change this setting.
* Default i2c address is A0=MID, A1=MID which translate to 0x2E

* The device needs to be in shutdown mode (address 00h, bit 0), then
* Need to set it to continuous mode
* Need to disable unused inputs
