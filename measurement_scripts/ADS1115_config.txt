ACS712 current sensor is simple

it states in the datasheet that it is supposed to cover -20 to 20 Amper with a sensitivity of 100mv/A
and should output a voltage of VCC*0.5 for 0 current. so that should be around 2.4V for 4.8 VCC.
The ADC + 4 sensors connected to the pi, in working condition, have a VCC of 4.94V (pi's 5V VDD was 4.95, so almost no drop)

*VCC should be a parameter in the measurements scripts

ADS1115 ADC is supposed to convert the sensor output voltage to digital data and send through i2c

it has a pointer register which defines the behavior, if we write to address 00 the pointer would point to converstion register
and if we write tot address 01 that is config register.

we have to config it first since the default mode is power-down sigle-shot mode and we want continuous. also it is differential by default, but we want 4 single channels.
(and we have to cycle through different chanels for measurement of 4 motors)

we don't have to do anything with threshold registers.

for CONFIG, we should write to address 0x01. the byte is as follows:
OS(1) - MUX(3) - PGA(3) - MODE(1)

MUX is for singe chanels:
100 A0
101 A1
110 A2
111 A3

PGA is the gain which defines full scale range.
000 2/3 -> full scale = 6.144v
001 1/1 -> full scale = 4.096v

MODE
0 continuous
1 single shot

for now we choose 001. why? since from 4V to 2.5V is about 1.5V which gives us a range of 15A in motor consumption.
if we see higher currents in the motors while full thrust, we can change this PGA to 000. note that this will NOT do harm to anything.
since the current sensor can not output more than VCC, which could have been bad for the ADC. so if anything larger than the full scale is the output of 
the sensor, we will get the maximum number in ADC (32767)

so for now we write 
0xC283 #11000010 10000011 #OS=1 MUX=100,A0_GND  PGA=001,1/1 MODE=0,cont. second byte default
0xD283 #11010010 10000011 #OS=1 MUX=101,A1_GND  PGA=001,1/1 MODE=0,cont. second byte default
0xE283 #11100010 10000011 #OS=1 MUX=110,A2_GND  PGA=001,1/1 MODE=0,cont. second byte default
0xF283 #11110010 10000011 #OS=1 MUX=111,A3_GND  PGA=001,1/1 MODE=0,cont. second byte default


default data rate is 128 SPS?? let's do measurements of 100Hz, so 8ms delay.
